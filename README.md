# JsonEditor

Hi! I've created the JSON Editor as a solution for a friend, 
who requested a simple way to edit a JSON in a specific way. 
One of her requirements was that the app should work on local files 
and not send anything through the web. 

During the process I learned how to load, parse, and save local JSON files from the browser. 

This is a very simple demo app. It lacks best practices as well as a decent UI. 
(Hopefully to be fixed in the near future :) )

## How to use
- The app is deployed at https://json-editor.shmool.me/
- To run locally, download the repo (or only the folder dist/json-editor) 
and open [index.html](https://github.com/shmool/json-editor/tree/main/dist/json-editor) in the browser.
- You can also clone the repo, run `npm i`, and work with the source code. 
See [instructions](#development-instructions) below.   

Note: I included the dist folder in the repo after running `ng build --prod`, 
and edited [index.html](https://github.com/shmool/json-editor/tree/main/dist/json-editor)
so that you can just go ahead and open it in the browser.
See the changes made to this file and to 
[.gitignore](https://github.com/shmool/json-editor/blob/main/.gitignore).

## Contributing
The main goal of this project is to learn.

All the relevant code currently exists in the [app folder](https://github.com/shmool/json-editor/tree/main/src/app),
specifically in the `ts` and `html` files.

Feel free to start conversations on [issues](https://github.com/shmool/json-editor/issues) and suggest PRs.
